# BCML: BOTW Cross-Platform Mod Loader

A mod merging and managing tool for _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_

## Purpose

Why a mod loader for BOTW? Installing a mod is usually easy enough once you have a
homebrewed console or an emulator. Is there a need for a special tool?

Yes. As soon as you start trying to install multiple mods, you will find complications.
The BOTW game ROM is fundamentally structured for performance and storage use on a
family console, without any support for modification. As such, files like the
[resource size table](https://zeldamods.org/wiki/Resource_system) or
[TitleBG.pack](https://zeldamods.org/wiki/TitleBG.pack) will almost inevitably begin to
clash once you have more than a mod or two. Symptoms can include mods simply taking no
effect, odd bugs, actors that don't load, hanging on the load screen, or complete
crashing. BCML exists to resolve this problem. It identifies, isolates, and merges the
changes made by each mod into a single modpack that just works.

## Prerequisites

-   Windows 10+ (7-8 _might_ work but are not officially supported) or basically any modern Linux
    distribution
-   A legal, unpacked game dump of _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ for Switch
    (version 1.6.0) or Wii U (version 1.5.0)
-   [The latest x64 Visual C++ redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads#section-2)
-   [The Edge WebView2 runtime](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703) (optional but recommended)
-   Cemu (optional)

## Setup

There are two main ways to install BCML.

### PyPI

Install Python 3.7+ (**64 bit version**), making sure to add it to your PATH, and then
run `pip install bcml`. **Note that, because of certain dependencies, on Windows
Python 3.9+ is not supported.**

**Note for Arch users**: BCML is now [on the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bcml-git/)
(thanks [ibrokemypie](https://github.com/ibrokemypie)), so you can install it with pamac or yay or
whatever your prefer.

**Note for other Linux users**: Because of the ways different distros handle Python packaging,
it often works better to install BCML in some contained environment. There are a few options for
this. The easiest would be to use [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx). You can install `pipx`
through pip, and then run `pipx install bcml`. In some cases you might need to also run `pipx
inject bcml pywebview[qt]`.

Another option for Linux users is using a virtual environment ("venv"). To do so, you can run
something like this:

```sh
python -m venv bcml_env
source bcml_env/bin/activate # will activate the venv
pip install bcml
```

### Building from Source

Building from source requires, in addition to the general prerequisites:

-   Python 3.7+ 64 bit

    *(Note: 3.9+ will not work on Windows until `pythonnet` is updated.)*

-   Node.js v14

-   mkdocs and mkdocs-material

    Run `pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material` if not using `bootstrap.sh`

Steps to build from source:

1. Install Python requirements

    1. Open terminal to repo root folder
    2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Prepare the webpack bundle

    1. Open terminal to `bcml/assets`
    2. Run `npm install`
    3. Run `npm run build` (or `npm run test` to watch while editing)

3. Build the docs

    1. Open terminal to repo root folder
    2. Run `mkdocs build`

4. Install BCML with `python setup.py install` or run without installing with
   `python -m bcml`

Note that on Linux, you can simply run `bootstrap.sh` to perform these steps
automatically unless you would like more control.

## Usage and Troubleshooting

For information on how to use BCML, see the Help dialog in-app or read the documentation
[on the repo](https://github.com/NiceneNerd/BCML/tree/master/docs). For issues and
troubleshooting, please check the official
[Troubleshooting](https://github.com/NiceneNerd/BCML/wiki/Troubleshooting) page.

BOTW is an immensely complex game, and there are a number of new mergers that could be
written. If you find an aspect of the game that can be complicated by mod conflicts, but
BCML doesn't yet handle it, feel free to try writing a merger for it and submitting a
PR.

Python and JSX code for BCML is subject to formatting standards. Python should be
formatted with Black. JSX should be formatted with Prettier, using the following
settings:

```json
{
    "prettier.arrowParens": "avoid",
    "prettier.jsxBracketSameLine": true,
    "prettier.printWidth": 88,
    "prettier.tabWidth": 4,
    "prettier.trailingComma": "none"
}
```

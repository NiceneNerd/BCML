# Welcome to BCML Help

Hello, thanks for downloading BCML: Breath of the Wild Cross-Platform Mod Loader. Modding
BOTW is far from a simple task, so I hope this little bundle of help pages will be of some
use as you seek your perfect mod setup. For the most common issues and problems, head
straight to the [Troubleshooting](trouble.md) page. If you're looking for
basic guidance on using BCML, stick around here.

## BCML 101

Here's how BCML works:

-   You [install mods](install.md) into BCML. Use the GameBanana tab or click the
    floating action button on the Mods tab to open the install dialog and go from there.
    (You can also drag-and-drop mods from your OS file browser.)
-   Use the sort handles if you need to edit load order. Use the Remege button liberally
    when anything goes wrong.
-   If you're a Cemu user, all installed mods should take effect next time you run the
    game.
-   You do _not_ have to launch BOTW from BCML. BCML installs its merged mods as a single
    graphic pack into your Cemu `graphicPacks` folder, and it will work the same as any
    other graphic pack mod.
-   If you're a console user, use the [Export](export.md) button to generate a
    merged pack pack to install with SDCafiine or Atmosphere or what-have-you.
